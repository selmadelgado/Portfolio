            <h2>About Me</h2><br>
            <div class="aboutMe">
                Long before media queries and responsive design, I was introduced to my first Macintosh in high school and fell in love with PageMaker and making things look good.   
                <br> <br>
                I became the Editor-in-Chief of my high school newspaper and that summer I worked at Kinko’s in their graphics department creating a countless number of brochures, business cards and logos and was introduced to branding, layout and typography.  I loved my job and at that time in my life, it was the best job ever. 
                <br> <br>
                
               <h3>“I’m a life-long learner”</h3> 
                <br>
                I discovered my real passion in 2001 when I was hired as a Business Analyst at ConocoPhillips responsible for maintaining the website for the Global Security department.  I taught myself HTML, CSS and ColdFusion, built an in-house enterprise-level application and fell in love with software development. 
                <br> <br>
                During my 13 years at ConocoPhillips, I got to work with some of the most amazing individuals and collaborate with remote teams on many projects to support the Global Security group.  
                I also traveled to various ConocoPhillips locations around the world to provide technical assistance and training.  
                <br> <br>
                In 2015, our department was <a href="http://static.conocophillips.com/files/resources/3qtr14_spirit-magazine.pdf" style="color:#CDA96D; font-weight: 600;">featured</a> in the company’s Spirit magazine. I was even awarded two Spirit Awards for my contributions to the company. I loved my job and at that and at that time in my life, it was the best job ever.
                <br> <br>

                <h3>“I love what I do”</h3>
                <br>
                I strongly believe in self-education and I have the motivation to never stop improving.  I’m currently attending the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Texas in Austin.  It has been both extremely challenging and also very rewarding.  In many ways I feel like I’m just getting started.   
                <br> <br>
                I am eager to join a team of creatives to collaborate with and contribute to exciting projects that can potentially reach people all over the world. I'm always interested to hear about projects to collaborate on.
