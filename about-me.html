            <h2>About Me</h2><br>
            <div class="project-description">
                Long before media queries and responsive design, I was I was introduced to my first Macintosh in high school and fell in love with page layout and making things look good.   
                <br> <br>
                I became the Editor of my high school newspaper and that summer I worked at Kinko’s in their graphics department creating a countless number of brochures, business cards and logos and had my first taste of layout and typography.  I loved my job and at that time in my life, it was the best job ever. 
                <br> <br>
                
                “I’m a life-long learner”
                <br> <br>
                I discovered my real passion in 2001 when I was hired as a Business Analyst at ConocoPhillips responsible for maintaining the website for the Global Security department.  I taught myself HTML, CSS and ColdFusion, built an in-house enterprise-level application and fell in love with software development. 
                <br> <br>
                During my 13 years at ConocoPhillips, I got to work with some of the most amazing individuals and collaborate with remote teams on many projects to support the Global Security group.  
                I also traveled to various ConocoPhillips locations around the world to provide technical assistance and training.  In 2015, our department was featured in the company’s Spirit magazine.   I loved my job and at that and at that time in my life, it was the best job ever.
                <br> <br>
                “I love what I do”
                <br> <br>
                I strongly believe in self-education and I have the motivation to never stop improving.  I’m currently attending the Full Stack Bootcamp at the University of Texas in Austin.  It has been both extremely challenging and also very rewarding.  In many ways I feel like I’m just getting started.   
                <br> <br>
                I am eager to join a team of creatives to collaborate with and contribute to exciting projects that can potentially reach people all over the world.   That’s a little bit about me,I’d like to learn a little about you.
                <br> <br>
                I'm always interested to chat or hear about projects to collaborate on.
